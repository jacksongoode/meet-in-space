_Description: SSL certificate for the Jitsi Meet instance
 Jitsi Meet is best to be set up with an SSL certificate.
 Having no certificate, a self-signed one will be generated.
 By choosing self-signed you will later have a chance to install Letâ€™s Encrypt certificates.
 Having a certificate signed by a recognised CA, it can be uploaded on the server
 and point its location. The default filenames will be /etc/ssl/--domain.name--.key
 for the key and /etc/ssl/--domain.name--.crt for the certificate.
